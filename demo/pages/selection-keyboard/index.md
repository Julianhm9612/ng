### Selection shortcuts
We have rows, cells and columns which we want to select either individually or contiguously.

|   Object      | Individual      | Contiguous                                                                         |
| ------------- |:-------------:  | -----                                                                              |
| Rows          | `shift+space`   | `shift+arrows` from current position (up/right and down/left functional equivalent)|
| Cells         | 	`space`       | `shift+arrows` from current position                                               |
| Columns       | `control+space` | `shift+arrows` from current position (up/right and down/left functional equivalent)|
| Grid          | `control+A` to select the entire grid                                                                |
